        <option>Why aren't you texting (insert name here) back?</option>
        <option>Hello! It appears that you've neglected to respond to (insert name here)' s message! You should respond soon!</option>
        <option>Wow, look at all those unanswered texts in your inbox! Especially that one from (insert name here)!</option>
        <option>It's cool, (insert name here) will wait.</option>
        <option>This is an auto-response. If you wish to maintain your positive relationship with (insert name here), please respond to their attempts to contact you. Thank you for your time.</option>
        <option>Guess you have better things to do than answer (insert name here)'s text...</option>
        <option>There was once a boy who didn't answer his phone. He died.</option>
        <option>Oh, so you fainted from the excitement of getting a text from (insert name here)? Totally understandable. Text them when you wake up!</option>
        <option>I saw you open (insert name here)'s Snapchat story, maybe you should answer their text, too!</option>
        <option>I saw you post on Instagram, maybe you should answer (insert name here)'s text, too!</option>
        <option>I saw you post on Twitter, maybe you should answer (insert name here)'s text, too!</option>
        <option>I saw you were on Facebook, maybe you should answer (insert name here)'s text, too!</option>
        <option>Is it normal for you to tell people to be in touch then to ignore their texts? I'm starting to wonder if you even care about (insert name here).</option>
        <option>Is it seriously taking you this long to respond to (insert name here)?"</option>
        <option>Sorry (insert name here) annoyed you with their friendship...</option>
        <option>I'm touched that you're so in awe that you can't even pull it together to text (insert name here) back.</option>
        <option>Apologies, I forgot that people in your contacts don't exist until you need them.</option>
        <option>Oh, I thought your thumbs had fallen off and you could no longer text anyone back...</option>
        <option>You should check your messages, it looks like there's one you didn't respond to!</option>
        <option>I hope you're writing (insert name here) a fucking essay.</option>
        <option>If you don't respond to your text messages, I will skin you and hang you on a tree. Like you will literally be flapping in the wind.</option>
        <option>As Abraham Lincoln once said, 'Answer your fucking phone.'</option>
        <option>If you don't answer your text messages, I will rip off your arm and slap you with the soggy end.</option> 
        <option>Custom option - write your own message in the box below!</option>
